### Hi there, I'm Sid 👋

I'm a recent Mechanical Engineering graduate from **IIT Roorkee** on a self-directed mission I call **'Exploring The Blockchain World'** I'm exploring about building the decentralized future and am documenting my entire learning journey in public.

---

#### 🔭 I’m currently working on:
- My foundational Solidity knowledge by building and refactoring smart contracts. Check out my first major project:
  - **[My First 5 Solidity Projects: A Beginner's Guide](https://github.com/Sidified/Solidity-Foundational-Projects)**

#### 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- Deep fundamentals of the EVM, Solidity, and gas optimization.
- Advanced smart contract security patterns.

#### 💬 Ask me about:
- Getting started in Web3 from a non-CS background.
- My learning process and the resources I'm using.

#### 📫 How to reach me:
- **X/Twitter:** [@Sid_Hary_](https://twitter.com/Sid_Hary_)
- **LinkedIn:** [Siddharth Choudhary](https://www.linkedin.com/in/siddharth-choudhary-797391215/)

#### ⚡ Fun fact:
- My actual name is **Siddharth Choudhary**, but I chose to make public profiles with the name **Sid Hary** (from **SID**dharth choud**HARY**) so that anyone in the world can easily pronounce and remember my name.
